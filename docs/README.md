# Documentation

To get started, go through the following tutorials that will go through installing, writing into the editor, adding formatting, and exporting the transcript.

## Get Started

Start with #3 if you already have Plover installed and know how to install Plover2CAT from the command line.

1. [Install Plover](tutorials/install-plover.md)
2. [Install Plover2CAT as a Plover plugin](tutorials/install-plover2cat.md)
3. [Create new transcript in Plover2CAT](tutorials/create-transcript.md)
4. [Write in the Plover2CAT editor](tutorials/writing-editor.md)
5. [Export to text and Open Document Format](tutorials/export-file.md)

## How To ____

Much of the following content is more useful if the Plover2CAT editor is open and there is already an existing transcript in the editor to visualize effects. The user should know what stenography is at this point, and can set up a machine / keyboard for writing through Plover.

## Getting help

Two ways: 1) Send a message over Discord. I am plants#4820 or 2) Open an issue on Github.

Helpful things to do: 
- Go to **Help > About** to view the version number.
- Compress and attach the entire transcript directory, or the `*.tape` and `*.transcript` files. 
- If possible, add steps to reproduce the problem. 
- Add the log output from running Plover (debug) after an attempt to cause the exact same error.
