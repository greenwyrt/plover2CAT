# Create New Transcript

`Plover2CAT` should be installed installed (see [previous tutorial](install-plover2cat.md)) for this tutorial.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a new transcript in Plover2CAT.

The editor window will open.

You will notice that even if you put the cursor into the editor area and enable Plover, nothing is written. A transcript folder has to be created first before writing.

## Create transcript folder

Click on **File > New** in the menu.

## Select location for transcript

A file dialog will appear. You will be allowed to select an existing folder from your filesystem or you can create a new folder.

## Make transcript name

The default name for the transcript uses the format `transcript-TIMESTAMP`. It is possible to change the default name to any that the file system will accept (those without forbidden characters such as `"` in Windows).

A folder with this name will be created containing necessary subfolders and text files.
