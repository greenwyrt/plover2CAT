An empty transcript will appear in the center editor, with a tab name of  `transcript-TIMESTAMP`. It is now possible to write into this editor. 

## Save transcript

To save the transcript, use **File > Save** or `Ctrl + S`  to save. 

The default name for the transcript uses the format `transcript-TIMESTAMP`. It is possible to change the default name to any that the file system will accept (those without forbidden characters such as `"` in Windows).

A folder with this name will be created containing necessary subfolders and text files.
