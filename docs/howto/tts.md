# Set up Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Plover2CAT can use the system's existing text-to-speech capabilities (TTS) to read aloud text. Use the Text to Speech panel in the Toolbox dock to control settings for TTS.

## Selection

Plover2CAT will read from the cursor position onwards in the document if no text is selected, or just the text selection. Plover2CAT sends the existing text for synthesis so if edits are made in the text after the cursor, the TTS playback will still speak the original text. 

## Voice selection and control

The voice for TTS depends on the the system. Changing the engine may change the locales available, and as a result, the voices available. Use the sliders to set volume, rate and pitch. 

## Playback

Click the Play button to start TTS, and use Stop to stop the playback. The Play button will be disabled until playback has ended or the Stop button is pressed.

If the engine does not have pause/resume capability, the Pause and Resume buttons are hidden. Otherwise, they can be used to pause and resume TTS.

Play and Stop also exist in the **Media** menu under **Play (TTS)** and **Stop (TTS)**. It is possible to assign keyboard shortcuts to these.
