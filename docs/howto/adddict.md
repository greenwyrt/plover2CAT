## How to add custom dictionary

Select a JSON dictionary file from the filesystem and load into Plover2CAT with `Add Custom Dictionary` under the `Dictionary` menu.

Use this instead of the Plover Add Dictionary function as Plover2CAT will copy the dictionary into the `dict/` folder. The dictionary will be loaded when the transcript is opened and removed from Plover automatically when the transcript is closed.

The `default.json` that Plover2CAT creates for each transcript is a good place to add transcript-specific outlines if there is only a few.
