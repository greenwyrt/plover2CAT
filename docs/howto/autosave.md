# Setup autosaving

At regular intervals, Plover2CAT will save the existing transcript to a hidden backup file. 

## Enabling/Disabling autosave

By default, autosave is enabled. To disable, go to the `Edit` menu and click on `Autosave`.

## Set autosave interval

The default autosave interval is 5 minutes. Click on `Edit` menu and then `Set Autosave Time` to change the minute value in the dialog. The minimum interval value is 1 minute.

## Accessing backup

The backup file uses the same same name as the transcript data file except with a period in front, resulting in `{transcript_name}.transcript`. This file will be set as hidden. Depending on the operating system and settings, the file may or may not be visible.

Open the file with any text editor and copy the contents, or rename the file to the transcript data file to use it.
