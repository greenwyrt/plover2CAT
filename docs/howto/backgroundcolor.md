# How to set the background color

The default background color is white for text displays, but can be customized. Go to `View` and then `Background Color`. The dialog window that pops up presents color selection choices. 

The color selected will be applied to all white backgrounds in text displays such as the main editor, the paper tape, history pane etc, and will be saved and maintained across sessions.

Note that changing background colors does not automatically change text colors, and may cause visibility issues.
