# How to set highlight colors

The text color of the different text elements (writing, automatic text etc.) can be set in **Preferences** and then **Highlight Colors**.

Click on the desired element type to change, such as **Automatic**. This will bring up a color picker dialog.

The highlight colors are applied throughout the editor, meaning it is not possible to have different colors for different transcripts. The color choices are also saved between sessions.

The color of the text is only applied in the editor. All exported formats, including ODF, will use the default black text color.
