# Set up and start audio recording

Plover2CAT can record audio through the computer's audio input if available. Video recording is not available.

Press **Audiovisual > Record/Pause** to start recording. This is also available on the toolbar. 

A dialog with settings will appear. There are several dropdown menus which display the default choices based on the platform and operating system. See [audio controls on the dialogs reference](../reference/dialogs.md). Click `OK` to start recording.

Press **Record/Pause** again to pause. 

To stop recording, press **Audiovisual > Stop Recording** menu.

Once audio recording has started, the settings cannot be changed. For example, if audio recording is paused, no settings can be changed. Pressing **Stop Recording** will end all recording, and then the settings can be changed.

Plover2CAT only allows one audio file type per transcript. Trying to record again will result in the previous file being over-written. For example, it is possible to have one `WAV` file and one `MP3` file, but not two `WAV` files.

The resulting recording is found in the `audio` folder within the transcript folder. Listening to the recording will depend on the codecs installed on the computer but VLC media player should play most formats.
