# How to skip forward and back in an audiovisual file

**Skip Forward** and **Skip Back** are located under the **Audiovisual** menu. Use them to skip forward/back in the track by 5 seconds. These functions also have shortcuts so it is possible to control them from the keyboard.

The Audio Control dock displays the present position along the track as a slider, with the position and duration on either end in `HH:MM:SS` format. Move the slider by clicking or dragging to skip to the time on the track. (This becomes less accurate if the file has a long duration).
