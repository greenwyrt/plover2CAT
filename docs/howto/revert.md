# How to revert to a previous version

Each time `Save` is clicked, a version of the transcript is saved. The different versions are tracked so that it is possible to revert to a previous saved transcript.

1. Go to **Edit > Revert Transcript**.
2. If the present transcript has unsaved changes, a dialog box will appear warning that changes will be lost. Click `No` to go back and save the transcript, or proceed with `Yes`.
3. Select the desired version from the dropdown list. This will also trigger a save at the same time. 

Versioned transcripts and autosave are not the same. Autosave only saves the transcript date, not styles/page configuration, and most importantly, only provides the last autosaved transcript. Versioned transcripts contain tracked changes over time.
