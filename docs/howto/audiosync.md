# Set up a time offset for syncing with writing

Plover2CAT will keep track of the audio time in addition to the real time of a stroke when an audiovisual file is being played. Both times will show up in the paper tape.

To add an offset to the recorded time, change the time offset located in the Audio Controls dock. By default, the offset is `0ms`. This value can be changed using the arrow buttons in the box. When an offset is set, the recorded audio time will be set off by the millisecond value.
