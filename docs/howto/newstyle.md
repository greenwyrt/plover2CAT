# How to create a new style

Creating a new style is through `Create New Style` under the `Styling` menu.

First position the cursor into a paragraph with the style you want to base the new style on. Then click `Create New Style`. A dialog window will appear asking for the name of the new style. Press `OK` to confirm the name after inputting the name. 

Right after new style creation, the style will be added to the list of style choices for `Current Paragraph Style`. At this point, it is possible to [modify the style properties](modstyle.md) as needed, including changing the parent style to inherit from and the next style.
