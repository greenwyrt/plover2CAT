# How to set playback rate

The playback rate is the rate that the audiovisual file is being played at. 

Plover2CAT displays the playback rate in the Audio Controls dock, `1.0x` by default. To change this value, click the up and down arrows in the input box to increment the value by +/-0.05. It is also possible to hover the mouse over the input box and scroll to change the value. The playback rate is limited to a value between 0.05 to 2.

Lastly, Plover2CAT has `Speed Up` and `Slow Down` under the Audiovisual` menu. These buttons will increment the playback rate up/down. The benefit is that these menu items have shortcuts so it is possible to assign outlines to control the playback rate without needing to move away from the keyboard.
