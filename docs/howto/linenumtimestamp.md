# How to enable line numbering and timestamps

Line numbering can be enabled for export. This option is a checkbox in the `Page Layout` page in the `Toolbox` dock.
When this is checked, each text line in supported export file formats will be numbered. For ODF text documents, setting `Frequency` means that every nth line is numbered rather than all text lines.

Line timestamping can also be enabled through its own checkbox. The timestamp value is based on the earliest chronological stroke in the line. Depending on editing, timestamps across lines may not be in order if sections of text (and steno) were moved around.
