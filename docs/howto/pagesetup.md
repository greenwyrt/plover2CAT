# How to set page size and margins

The page size is used to determine page size for supported export formats, and it also sets the width of the text in the editor. 

The page margins are not used in the editor when displaying text, only for exporting.

These page properties controls are located under `Page Format` in the `Toolbox` pane and are all in inch units. Use the up/down buttons to adjust the value or edit directly using the keyboard. Changes are saved once the `Enter` key is pressed or the cursor is moved away.
